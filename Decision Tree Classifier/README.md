Aside from the usual path which is importing the model using scikit learn I used graphviz to visualize the decision tree better.

Iris dataset is used to train the model with 80% of data used as training dataset and the rest as test.

I created some random examples that came to my mind and then used the model on the examples to see what the outcome can be. I just did this as an experiment.
